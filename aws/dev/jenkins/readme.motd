                                            Bitnami Jenkins

  *** Welcome to the Bitnami WildFly 8.2.0-1  Jenkins      ***
  This is an extremely nonstandard install of Jenkins which is a standalone jar deploy
    see /etcinit.d/jenkins and /etc/default/jenkins

  Dematic LABS Specific Modifications:
  /etc/default/jenkins modified to use non boot data volume
  JENKINS_HOME=/data/jenkins

  Extra Installs on top of Bitnami Stack
  * ansible/boto

  Will deinstall apache with nginx
  /opt/bitnami/apache2/  - not configured correctly by bitnami and needs cleanup

  ( jenkins db and root home are still reside on the boot volume.
  did not want to move too much all at once. )
